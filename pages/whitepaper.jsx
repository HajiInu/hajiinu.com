            <br />
            <strong>Decentralized</strong>

            <br />
            trade: you have 100% ownership of your tokens, and you can trade
            directly from your wallet.

            Like other AMM decentralized exchanges, you can earn trading fees

            tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

            DeFi users, the cheapest gas
            <br />
            fee, and the fastest transaction speed.

            <strong>Get Started</strong>
            <br />
            To get started on HajiInu, the first thing you will need is to set
            up a wallet that supports
            <br />
            Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
            <br />
            When you set up a wallet, follow the guide carefully and safely back
            up your recovery phrases.
            <br />
            We recommend the below wallets for simple setup and ease of use:
            <br />
            Desktop/Web Browser:
            <br />
            MetaMask - (Guide)
            <br />
            Mobile/App:
            <br />

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Get BEP Token</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The native tokens of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are on BEP20.
            <br />
            To do most things on BSC, you will need to pay gas, which comes in
            the form of BEP20 BNB.
            <br />
            You will also need the BEP20 version of any token you want to trade,
            stake, etc., on BSC.
            <br />
            To get BEP20 tokens, we recommend the below ways:
            <br />
            Binance.com - You can withdraw tokens as BEP20 via your Binance account
            (if you have one).
            <br />
            Bear in mind you need an account to do so.
            <br />
            Here&#39;s a quick guide they made to help you out.
            <br />
            You can also withdraw BEP20 tokens from other centralized exchanges
            (more and more
            <br />
            exchanges support BEP20 now)
          </p>

            <strong>Token Swaps</strong>
            <br />
            HajiInu lets users trade without the need to go through a
            Centralized Exchange.
            <br />
            Everything you do on HajiInu is routed directly through your own
            wallet-no need to trust
            <br />
            someone else with your coins!
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Liquidity Pools</strong>
            <br />
            The HajiInu exchange can only operate when there&#39;s enough
            liquidity to support trades; if
            <br />
            nobody wanted to sell you BNB for example, then it wouldn&#39;t
            matter how much you wanted to
            <br />
            trade for some.
            <br />
            Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you
            rewards in the form of trading
            <br />
            fees for making sure there&#39;s always liquidity for the exchange
            to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Yield Farm</strong>
            <br />
            Yield Farms allow you to stake Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens to earn
            HAJIINU on HajiInu. The
            <br />
            LP tokens come from Liquidity pools by adding tokens to provide
            liquidity.
            <br />
            Each farm has its own APR, depending on the value of LP tokens,
            reward multiplier, and price of
            <br />
            HAJIINU.
            <br />
            Yield farming can give better rewards than Pools, but it comes with
            a risk of Impermanent Loss.
            <br />
            It&#39;s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about
            the concept before you get started.
